# Web Component Example
- Requires ES6 support in Node. Suggest using Node v14+.

## Basic Functionality
Demonstrates the creation of a basic web component using separate CSS, HTML, and JS files.

## Notes Regarding Web Components
The most important thing I can mention here is that custom component tags must contain a dash which is why this component uses the x-counter tag. It could really be anything including the name of your organization or project.

## Needs
- Folder structure, so that things aren't so cluttered.
- Documentation to explain each step.
