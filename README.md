- Uses a separate CSS file for component styling.
- Uses a separate HTML file for component markup.
- Uses a separate JS file for component functionality.

# Notes Regarding Web Components
- The most important thing I can mention here is that custom component tags must contain a dash which is why this component uses the x-counter tag.

# Needs
- Folder structure, so that things aren't so cluttered.
- Documentation to explain each step.
